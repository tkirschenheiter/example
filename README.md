Homework 2 - Music Playlist

This repository was created to demonstrate the implementation of reading in multiple files and sorting it, then using the data to build
a playlist and a song history list.

Author notes. This repository was created by Taylor Kirschenheiter for assignment 2 of CISC 3130.
I changed the file into a TSV file (program will only work with TSVs) because of the extra use of commas in song and artist names. 
To use program simply convert any CSV into a TSV.

Installation/Set-Up:
Open all the java files within a project. File with main is musicPlaylistMain. Use relative path of files from src folder if you add more. Description on how mehtods and files work inside program.
Run program.

Output:
Images of console from print statements in program.

Dependencies:
Java 8
